# Navier-Stokes in Extractive Metallurgical Systems

A collaborative academic research project exploring the application of Navier-Stokes equations to model fluid flow, mass transfer, and thermodynamic behavior in high-temperature extractive metallurgy processes.

## Overview

This project investigates how fluid dynamics—governed by the Navier-Stokes equations—can be applied to simulate and optimize industrial metallurgical operations like:

- Smelting & matte converting  
- Electrolytic refining  
- Slag freeze-lining  
- Molten metal stirring & gas injection

We analyzed key challenges such as multiphase flow modeling, turbulence, and temperature-dependent material properties using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques.

## Key Contributions

- Modeled fluid flow in metallurgical furnaces using DNS, RANS, and LES solvers
- Applied Navier-Stokes equations to simulate slag behavior and bubble flow
- Analyzed energy and mass transfer dynamics in electrolytic refining cells
- Identified operational limitations (e.g., high-temperature complexity, turbulence, non-Newtonian flows)
- Proposed solutions to mitigate modeling and computational challenges

## Tools & Methods

- Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
- Navier-Stokes equation solvers (RANS, LES, DNS)
- Energy and momentum conservation modeling
- Thermodynamic & reaction kinetics coupling
- Radial Distribution Functions (RDF) for phase analysis
